# Simple Platformer

This is a little test I did using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It may not work, though.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move and jump.
- Avoid falling off the platforms.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## Link
